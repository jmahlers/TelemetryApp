# About

<a href="https://sae.wustl.edu/">Wash U Racing<a/> is Washington University in St. Louis' Formula SAE team. We design, build, and compete a formula style race car every year.

This serves as a iOS telemetry client for the WashU Racing sensor suite written in Swift. It features live graphing of telemetry data and graphing of previous runs from the sensor database using the iOS Charts framework. Telemetry data is ingressed from the existing WashU Racing SSE server using the EventSource library. Dynamic sensor additions and removals are supported in addition to a sensor favoriting system. The most important sensors can be pinned to a dock which can be expanded to show the current raw value of each sensor.

## Live Telemetry Graphing

* Using iOS Charts, the live telemetry graphs updated at up to 10 Hz.
* Both the raw scatter plot and a rolling average trendline are shown.

## Weather View

* Using the Dark Sky API, real time temperature, wind speed and other weather statistics are provided for the test locations.

## Built With

* [EventSource](https://github.com/inaka/EventSource) - SSE Client
* [iOS Charts](https://www.scichart.com/) - Graphing Framework

## Library Installation
    pod 'IKEventSource'
    pod 'SciChart'
The library for SciCharts can be found at <https://www.scichart.com/>. You will also need a SciCharts license.

For WashU racing members, the library is on the 2020 Grabcad under Frame/TelemetryApp/. There is also a copy of my SciCharts license; the license is in perpetuity for the version 2.0.
Contact Jeff Ahlers or Jake Kendrick in order to transfer one of our licenses.
